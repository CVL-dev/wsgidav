Using WsgiDav with SSL
======================

The default server used with WsgiDav's standalone executable is CherryPy's WSGI server.  For more details, see wsgidav/server/cherrypy_wsgiserver/__init__.py :

    This won't call the CherryPy engine (application side) at all, only the
    WSGI server, which is independant from the rest of CherryPy. Don't
    let the name "CherryPyWSGIServer" throw you; the name merely reflects
    its origin, not its coupling.

We can enable SSL in CherryPy as follows:

python-pip install pyopenssl
# This will install from source, so you will need to have done "yum -y install python-devel".

yum -y install openssl
# Generate self-signed certificate:
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 3650 -nodes

See these lines in wsgidav.conf for how to specify the SSL certificate and private key:

ssl_certificate = "/opt/mytardis/current/wsgidav/ssl/server.crt"
ssl_private_key = "/opt/mytardis/current/wsgidav/ssl/server.key"
